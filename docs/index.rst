### Workflow for Checking an Application for a Vacancy

Here’s a simplified non-technical explanation of the workflow for how an application for a vacancy is checked by the system, along with a list of what needs to be done to validate the application.

---

### **1. Application Submission**
When an applicant applies for a vacancy, they submit an application with personal details, documents, academic qualifications, work experience, publications, family information, and addresses.

---

### **2. The System Checks the Application**

Once the application is submitted, the system automatically performs a series of checks to ensure that the applicant meets all the required criteria for the specific vacancy. Here’s what the system checks:

#### **A. Check for Required Documents**
- **What the system does**: The system looks at the list of required documents for the vacancy (such as citizenship, education certificates, etc.). It then checks if the applicant has uploaded all the required documents.
- **What needs to be done**: The applicant must upload the necessary documents. The system will verify that all required documents are uploaded or not. All the uploaded documents are manually verified by the BPKIHS administration

#### **B. Check for Family Records**
- **What the system does**: The system checks if the applicant has provided the necessary family details. For example, it will check if the applicant has provided information about their father and mother (as required).
- **What needs to be done**: The applicant needs to provide family details, including their father and mother’s information.

#### **C. Check for Address Records**
- **What the system does**: The system verifies if the applicant has provided both a temporary and permanent address. These addresses are required for the application to be valid.
- **What needs to be done**: The applicant needs to provide both a temporary and permanent address in the application.

#### **D. Check for Work Experience**
- **What the system does**: The system checks if the applicant has the required work experience for the vacancy. This is based on the vacancy's requirements (e.g., years of experience in a certain field).
- **What needs to be done**: The applicant needs to have work experience that matches the vacancy’s requirements. If no experience is required, this check will pass automatically.

#### **E. Check for Publications**
- **What the system does**: The system checks if the applicant has published enough research or articles (if required for the vacancy). The system compares the number of publications with the vacancy’s requirement.
- **What needs to be done**: The applicant needs to provide information about their publications if required.

#### **F. Check for Required Degrees**
- **What the system does**: The system checks if the applicant has the required academic qualifications (e.g., degrees or certifications). The system compares the degrees submitted with the ones required by the vacancy.
- **What needs to be done**: The applicant needs to have the academic qualifications (degrees) required by the vacancy. The system will check their academic records to ensure all required degrees are provided.

---

### **3. Overall Application Validation**

After performing all the checks, the system evaluates whether the application meets **all** the necessary requirements. Here’s the process:

- **If all checks pass**: The application is considered valid, and the applicant is eligible to proceed with further steps (such as an interview, etc.).
- **If any check fails**: The system will notify the applicant which specific requirement has not been met. For example, it may say, "You need to upload your degree certificate" or "Your application is missing a publication."

---

### **4. Workflow Summary (What Needs to be Done)**

To successfully apply for a vacancy, the applicant needs to do the following:

1. **Upload All Required Documents**: Ensure all documents specified in the vacancy description are uploaded.
   - Examples: ID proof, educational certificates, work experience letters, etc.
   
2. **Provide Family Details**: Include details about your family (e.g., father and mother’s information).
   
3. **Provide Address Information**: Submit both temporary and permanent addresses.
   
4. **Meet Work Experience Requirements**: Make sure you have the necessary work experience as specified by the vacancy.
   - Example: Years of experience in a particular job or field.
   
5. **Meet Publication Requirements**: If the vacancy requires publications (e.g., research articles), ensure they are listed.
   
6. **Meet Degree Requirements**: Ensure that your educational qualifications (degrees) match the requirements of the vacancy.

---

### **5. Application Review Outcome**

The system will automatically check all these requirements and validate the application based on the following:

- **All checks are passed**: The application is complete, and the applicant meets all the requirements. The applicant can proceed to the next step in the process (e.g., interview or selection).
  
- **Any check fails**: The system will inform the applicant of the specific missing or invalid requirement, such as missing documents, missing degrees, or insufficient work experience. The applicant will need to correct or provide the missing information.

---

### **6. Conclusion**

The system works as an automated assistant to verify whether an applicant meets all the necessary criteria for a vacancy. This saves time for both the applicant and the organization, ensuring that only complete and qualified applications move forward in the hiring process.

If anything is missing or incomplete, the applicant is notified so they can provide the necessary information and meet all the requirements before the application can proceed.
