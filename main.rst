Workflow for Checking an Application for a Vacancy
==================================================

Here’s a simplified, non-technical explanation of how an application for a vacancy is checked by the system, along with a list of actions required to validate the application.

---

**1. Application Submission**

When an applicant submits an application for a vacancy, they are required to provide personal details, documents, academic qualifications, work experience, publications, family information, and addresses.

---

**2. The System Checks the Application**

Once the application is submitted, the system automatically performs a series of checks to ensure the applicant meets the criteria for the vacancy. The system checks the following:

**A. Check for Required Documents**  
- **What the system does**: The system verifies if the applicant has uploaded all the required documents (such as citizenship certificate, educational qualifications, etc.).  
- **What needs to be done**: Ensure all required documents are uploaded. The system will verify that they are present. All documents are also manually verified by the BPKIHS administration.

**B. Check for Family Records**  
- **What the system does**: The system checks if the applicant has provided the necessary family details, such as information about their father and mother (as required).  
- **What needs to be done**: Provide details about your family, including the required information about your father and mother.

**C. Check for Address Records**  
- **What the system does**: The system verifies if both a temporary and permanent address have been provided. These are necessary for the application to be valid.  
- **What needs to be done**: Provide both a temporary and permanent address.

**D. Check for Work Experience**  
- **What the system does**: The system checks if the applicant has the required work experience, based on the vacancy's requirements (e.g., years of experience in a specific field).  
- **What needs to be done**: Ensure that your work experience matches the vacancy's requirements. If work experience is not required, this check will pass automatically.

**E. Check for Publications**  
- **What the system does**: The system checks if the applicant has the required number of publications (research articles, etc.), if applicable to the vacancy.  
- **What needs to be done**: Provide information about any relevant publications, if required.

**F. Check for Required Degrees**  
- **What the system does**: The system checks if the applicant has the academic qualifications (degrees or certifications) required by the vacancy.  
- **What needs to be done**: Ensure you meet the educational qualification requirements for the vacancy. The system will verify that all degrees are provided.

---

**3. Overall Application Validation**

After completing all checks, the system evaluates whether the application meets all the necessary requirements. The process is as follows:

- **If all checks pass**: The application is considered valid, and the applicant can proceed to the next steps (e.g., interview or selection).  
- **If any check fails**: The system will notify the applicant about the specific requirement that has not been met (e.g., "You need to upload your degree certificate" or "Your application is missing a publication").

---

**4. Workflow Summary (What Needs to be Done)**

To successfully apply for a vacancy, the applicant needs to ensure the following:

1. **Upload All Required Documents**: Make sure all the required documents are uploaded, such as ID proof, educational certificates, and work experience letters.  
2. **Provide Family Details**: Include the necessary family information, such as details about your father and mother.  
3. **Provide Address Information**: Submit both your temporary and permanent addresses.  
4. **Meet Work Experience Requirements**: Ensure your work experience matches the vacancy’s criteria (e.g., years of experience in a specific job or field).  
5. **Meet Publication Requirements**: If applicable, ensure you list any required publications, such as research articles or papers.  
6. **Meet Degree Requirements**: Make sure your educational qualifications meet the requirements outlined in the job description.

---

**5. Application Review Outcome**

The system will automatically check all these requirements and validate your application:

- **If all checks pass**: The application is considered complete, and the applicant can proceed to the next steps (e.g., interview or selection).  
- **If any check fails**: The system will notify the applicant about the specific missing or invalid requirement, such as missing documents or insufficient work experience. The applicant will need to address these issues before proceeding.

---

**6. Conclusion**

The system acts as an automated assistant, verifying whether an applicant meets the necessary criteria for a vacancy. This saves time for both the applicant and the organization, ensuring only complete and qualified applications progress in the hiring process.

If anything is missing or incomplete, the applicant will be notified to provide the necessary information and meet all the requirements before the application can proceed.
